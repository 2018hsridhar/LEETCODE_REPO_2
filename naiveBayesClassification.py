Working with Python Jupyter Notebooks
Goal : To Explore Supervised Learning Methods -> in this case, Naive Bayes Classification
We predicate many SL methods off of the NB method

Setting up Pythonic Naive Bayes Classification.
Let's explore how to evolve and iterate on a classificier from two class ( binomial ) to multi class.
We'll also explore the methods of TF ( Total Frequency ), IDF ( Inverse Document Frequency ), and TF-IDF ( which combines the two as a product ).
Lastly, we'll also explore vectorization of counts based on a vocabulary of words, and representing non-mathematical inputs more mathematically.
